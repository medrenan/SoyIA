# <p align="center"> *The Project* ðŸ“š

<p align="justify">The project constitutes an addition of a new tool to an application made in another project for Visiona. In this tool it was necessary to go to the field to count pods and grains for its use and this required time from the farmer,the idea of creating a tool with artificial intelligence for automatic and visual counting of these grains was created and given to us to develop.</p>

# <p align="center"> *What we delivery* ðŸ¤”

<p align="justify">In this delivery we focused on the studies and development of AI, we spent most of it with studying and putting into practice already with the images that will be used throughout the project, we had small advances in relation to the AI â€‹â€‹of its identification with the soybean pods, which is the main requirement for its delivery. </p>

  Result of the AI â€‹â€‹model trained to identify soybean pods present in the plant:

  </p>

  <p align="justify">
        It is possible to identify that at the moment our Artificial Intelligence is not able to recognize all the pods present in the plant, demonstrating that the model still needs improvements that will be implemented in the next Sprints.

<p align="justify">During our delivery we had some difficulties in terms of studies but we had a good advance in the middle of our delivery, having no obstacles for its completion.
