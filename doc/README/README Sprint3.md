# <p align="center"> *The Project* 📚

<p align="justify">The project constitutes an addition of a new tool to an application made in another project for Visiona. In this tool it was necessary to go to the field to count pods and grains for its use and this required time from the farmer,the idea of creating a tool with artificial intelligence for automatic and visual counting of these grains was created and given to us to develop.</p>

<p align="justify"> In this 3rd Sprint it was decided to integrate the AI ​​with the application and being the counting of pod seeds via pixel, screen automation and new functionality for the user to remove their pod samples. </p>

# <p align="center"> *Burndown* 📉

<p align="justify">During our delivery we had some difficulties in terms of having to run the front and back end project together, so we had a lot of effort for this task, making it difficult to redesign the app screens by delaying tasks planned for this sprint, focusing on improving the AI.
