In this tool it was necessary to go to the field to count pods and grains for its use and this required time from the farmer,the idea of creating a tool with artificial intelligence for automatic and visual counting of these grains was created and given to us to develop.</p>

# <p align="center"> *Project in Operation* 📱💻

Em desenvolvimento


# <p align="center"> *Burndown* 📉

<p align="justify">During our delivery we had some difficulties in terms of having to run the front and back end project together, so we had a lot of effort for this task, making it difficult to redesign the app screens by delaying tasks planned for this sprint, focusing on improving the AI.
