# <p align="center"> *The Project* 📚

<p align="justify">The project constitutes an addition of a new tool to an application made in another project for Visiona. In this tool it was necessary to go to the field to count pods and grains for its use and this required time from the farmer,the idea of creating a tool with artificial intelligence for automatic and visual counting of these grains was created and given to us to develop.</p>

<p align="justify"> In this 4rd Sprint we focused on the main functionality of the application, which would be to bring information on the amount of soybeans present in the photo used by the user in the application.  </p>

| Story | Why |
| --- | --- |
| <p align="center"> I, as an user, want the amount of soybean seeds present in my pod  |  <p align="center"> To make my work easier and to be able to use this information for my own interests
| <p align="center"> I, as an user, want to be able to edit my pod sample |  <p align="center"> So that I can change my sample information according to my interests  

       
# <p align="center"> *Project in Operation* 📱💻

Our main delivery for this sprint is the main functionality of the application, the user being able to use the image of his sample in the application and it returns the number of soybean seeds.

# <p align="center"> *Burndown* 📉

<p align="justify">During our delivery we had some difficulties in terms of having to run the front and back end project together, so we had a lot of effort for this task, making it difficult to redesign the app screens by delaying tasks planned for this sprint, focusing on improving the AI.
